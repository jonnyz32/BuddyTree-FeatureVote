A simple voting feature using React for the frontend and Flask with Psql for the backend and database.

To add and vote on features, you must be logged in. To simulate different user logins go to
the route https://buddytree-feature-vote.herokuapp.com/<userId> where <userId> is any number of your 
  choosing. Ex. https://buddytree-feature-vote.herokuapp.com/2
  
  This app will save your votes and you can unvote on anything that you've voted on (provided
  that the url is set to the userId you used to vote on said feature). You may not 
  delete a feature however because other users may be interested in that feature. Happy voting!
